# Python-for-Data-Analysts
Here I got my Python hands-on experience, and I learned a lot of new things, such as how to describe Python data acquisition and analysis techniques.Analyze Python data using a dataset, Read data using Python's Pandas package, Identify and describe three Python libraries.

The Excel sheet is also there, so please check it out. That file has Exploratory Data Analysis and Anomaly Detection in our data, so many concepts are there.
